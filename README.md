# HTC-Structures
Structures of postulated HTC components for XANES calcs.

Geometry Optomisation:
Ground state geometry optomisation performed using ORCA software with following:
functional set:  B3LYP
basis set:	 ma-def2-TZVP
aux basis set:	 def2/J
dispersion Corr: D3

List of Structures:
Structure Name	Type		Notes
5HMF		Reference	Literature suggests hydroxymethylfurfural as the HTC subunit.
DHA		Reference	Dihydoxyacetone - suggested to be a major linking unit
Formic Acid	Reference	Formic Acid - Typically formed during HTC from HPLC measurements.
Levullinic Acid	Reference	Levullinic Acid - Typically formed during HTC from HPLC measurements.
apath_HMF00	Alpha-C		HMF binding alpha-C pathway 0 - Alpha carbon bonding with no linking unit.
apath_HMF01	Alpha-C		HMF binding alpha-C pathway 1 - Alpha carbon bonding with 01 linking unit.
apath_HMF02	Alpha-C		HMF binding alpha-C pathway 2 - Alpha carbon bonding with 02 linking unit.
apath_HMF02_O	Alpha-C		HMF binding alpha-C pathway 2 with ketone - as above with ketone O=C.
apath_HMF03	Alpha-C		HMF binding alpha-C pathway 3 - Alpha carbon bonding with 02 linking unit.
bpath_HMF01	Beta-C		HMF binding beta-C pathway 1 - Beta carbon bonding with single linking unit.
bpath_HMF02	Beta-C		HMF binding beta-C pathway 2 - 2 alpha 1 Beta carbon bonding with 0 linking units.
